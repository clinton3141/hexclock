     A whole new way to look at time.

I wanted to create a new way to visualise
time, so I wrote hexclock. It changes the
background colour so that each second has
a different colour. Like a real clock,
the same time is represented in exactly the
same way. 

I guess if you had a super-hero strength
sense of colour, you could learn to tell
the time with it. 

Enjoy!
